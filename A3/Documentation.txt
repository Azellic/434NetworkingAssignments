-Routers that are not currently connected are not printed to stdout, just to
keep things clean.

-The distance between two routers caps at 99, because the message between two
routers can only hold two digits of distance per router

-Messages between routers contain information about all possible routers, even
if they have never been connected, so that lost connections can be broadcasted

-For the two seconds between printing the table, messages are received
regarding distance. The contents of these messages are stored in routerMessages
until the two seconds are up, and then the actual routerTable is updated before
being printed. routerMessages is then reset. This is to allow for multiple
messages to be compared at once.

-The names, distance, and next hop are stored in routerTable as integers. This
makes indexing, and cross-referencing easy.

-Nothing was implemented to prevent common dead connections problems, e.g.
count to infinity. This was intentional, since it wasn't asked for.

-Due to the way I implemented things, when a router fails it may appear in the
router table of its neighbour for a cycle, disappear, and then start counting
to infinity. Since counting to infinity (or 99, in this case) is already
improper, I did not hunt down the cause of this strange behavior, but I did
notice it.
