Design decisions:

Part A1:
1) Acks are the last received in order sequence number. This makes removing old
messages from the sender queue slightly easier, and is a matter of personal
preference, but sender and receiver must agree on this to function.

2) The receiver will not print new packets received until a user has answered
the Y/N question. In a system with real packet corruption this would be not be
the case.

3) In general, acks sent by the receiver are non cumulative. The sender can
receive cumulative acks, but the only time this would be relevant would be if a
previous ack had failed the check to be sent.

4)As with Assignment 1, typing "quit" will cause the sender to exit. This does
not effect the receiver, however. 

5)The message queue is 2 * the sending window size. This prevents the window
from wrapping around. If the user enters too many messages, a warning will be
printed on the screen.
